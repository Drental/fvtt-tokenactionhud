# Usage

Once activated, selecting a token that has an actor/character sheet associated with it and that you have permission to control should display an an action bar that is populated with the actions and abilities available for that token. The HUD can be disabled on a per-user basis if so desired.

Offers a variety of settings including support for third-party roll handlers (Please contact me if you'd like to add yours, or improve the functionality of those offered), and can be repositioned.
